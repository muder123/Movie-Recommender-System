# Movie-Recommender-System

This Project mainly focused on learning different filtering techniques used in Recommender Systems.

Did not code from scratch as the purpose of the Capstone is understanding and inplementation.

Special thanks to Ibtesam Ahmed for the introduction on Demographic filtering and Content-based filtering; and Frank Kane for the tutorial on User-based & Item- based Collaborative filtering.

Python is the programming language to achieve this. (the code may not be perfectly organised for others' use, content in parenthesis will be removed when reorganised)
